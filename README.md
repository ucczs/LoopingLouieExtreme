* Manual speed adjustment with a rotary control
* Random speed forward
* Random speed forward and backward
* Limited speed manipulation of the players by "item buttons" (increase and decrease speed once per game)

### Hardware list:
* Looping Louie
* Arduino Nano
* L293D (driver for the motor)
* 4 x 74HC595 (shift register)
* 9V Power Supply
* Transistors
* Resistors
* LEDs
